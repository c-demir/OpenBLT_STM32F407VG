# OpenBLT Customization for STM32F407VG-DISC1
*I have modified OpenBLT to enable it work with STM32F407VG-DISC1 board*.
*I have used the template that could be found [here](https://github.com/feaser/openblt/tree/master/Target/Demo/_template).*
*The demo project I based off is ARMCM4_STM32F4_Olimex_STM32P405_CubeIDE.*
